  abstract =      {The coastal upwelling region near Cape Blanco, Oregon
                   (43$\,^{\circ}$N) off the west coast of the United
                   States was studied using a towed \{CTD\} on SeaSoar,
                   a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP),
                   satellite sea surface temperature maps and surface
                   drifters during August 1995. The equatorward
                   upwelling jet was inshore of the shelfbreak north of
                   Cape Blanco, meandered gently offshore around the
                   Cape, and then veered sharply offshore just to the
                   south of the Cape. Analysis of vertical sections of
                   density, velocity and ``spiciness'' confirmed the
                   separation of an upwelling jet and front; the jet was
                   followed from over the shelfbreak north of the Cape
                   to 100 km offshore downstream of the Cape. The
                   separating jet originates from the coastal upwelling
                   jet leaving the shelf, but is augmented by an
                   offshore branching of the poleward undercurrent. By
                   combining information from \{ADCP\} streamfunction
                   maps with analysis of hydrographic data, including
                   distributions of the tracer-like quantity
                   ``spiciness'', a conceptual model of the
                   three-dimensional circulation near the Cape emerges.
                   A mid-shelf upwelling jet encounters a coastal
                   promontory then turns offshore, stretching and
                   deepening as it crosses the continental margin. The
                   jet then turns back shoreward (cyclonically) where
                   the deepened equatorward flow encounters the top of
                   the poleward undercurrent flowing along the
                   continental slope. This causes a portion of the
                   undercurrent to turn offshore to join and strengthen
                   the equatorward transport in the separated jet.
                   Throughout the separation process the coastal
                   upwelling front and jet are continuous, robust
                   features. Separation of a coastal upwelling jet is an
                   important mechanism for cross-shelf transport from
                   the coast to the deep ocean. Cape Blanco appears to
                   be the northernmost point where an equatorward jet
                   regularly separates from the coast to become an
                   oceanic jet and thus serves as the northern boundary
                   of the region where an intense meandering current,
                   characteristic of the California Current System, is
                   found offshore. Drifters released late in the
                   upwelling season are swept offshore and equatorward
                   near the Cape, interact with the spatially complex
                   circulation associated with the separated jet, and
                   then return to the continental margin with the
                   seasonal reversal in winds and near-surface
                   currents.},
