\abstract{Slowly-evolving stratified flow over rough topography is subject to substantial drag due to internal motions, but often numerical simulations are carried out at resolutions where this ``wave'' drag must be parameterized.  Here we highlight the importance of internal drag from topography with scales that cannot radiate internal waves, but may be highly non-linear, and we propose a simple parameterization of this drag that has a minimum of fit parameters compared to existing schemes. The parameterization smoothly transitions from a quadratic drag law ($\sim hu_0^2$) for low-$Nh/u_0$ (linear wave dynamics) to a linear drag law ($\sim h^2 u_0 N$) for high-$Nh/u_0$ flows (non-linear blocking and hydraulic dynamics), where $N$ is the stratification, $h$ is the height of the topography, and $u_0$ is the near-bottom velocity; the parameterization does not have a dependence on Coriolis frequency.  Simulations carried out in a channel with synthetic bathymetry and steady body forcing indicate that this parameterization accurately predicts drag across a broad range of forcing parameters when the effect of reduced near-bottom mixing is taken into account by reducing the effective height of the topography.  The parameterization is also tested in simulations of wind-driven channel flows that generate mesoscale eddy fields, a setup where the downstream transport is sensitive to the bottom drag parameterization and its effect on the eddies.  In these simulations, the parameterization replicates the effect of rough bathymetry on the eddies.  If extrapolated globally, the sub-inertial topographic scales can account for 2.7 TW of work done on the low-frequency circulation, an important sink that is redistributed to mixing in the open ocean.}
