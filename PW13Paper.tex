\section{Introduction}

Cross-shelf exchange is important to the health and productivity of continental shelf regions, where offshore nutrients and oxygenated water is exchanged with nutrient and oxygen depleted near-shore water.  Cross-shelf transport requires a level of ageostrophic flow since balanced flow will tend to follow topographic contours, often providing a barrier to lateral exchange.  Mechanisms for cross-shelf exchange include internal waves and instabilities in shelf-break fronts.  Most-dramatically, however, topography can drive cross-slope exchanges, often seen most clearly in surface

\section{Site and Methods}
\label{sec:Site}

Data collection was between 21 and 30 August, 2013, aboard the \emph{R/V Falkor}.  The study site was the southern portion of the Vancouver Island Shelf (\fref{fig:LocMapBoth}a), a particularly complicated region due to the bathymetry and varied forcing.

The pink arrow indicates southward flow of the coastal upwelling current.  The dashed box indicates the approximate limits of the study area.  b) The study area with standard hydrographic casts indicated in yellow dots, and Moving Vessel Profiler casts as red dots.

Grey cross-slope lines are cross sections indicated in \fref{fig:CrossSectionsSpice}.  Along-slope grey lines are every 20 km in the cross-slope direction, with $x=0\ \mathrm{km}$ near the 100-m isobath at the north end of the observation area.
